## Planning Center to Audio Engineering
This is an ongoing project designed specifically for non-audio engineers at my local church to simplify tasks and provide a seamless experience in audio engineering. This app leverages the power of the Planning Center API to effortlessly handle singer/instrumentalist and volume data for songs and services.
